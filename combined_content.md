## Astro-Physics & Astronomy
Cosmology and Astrophysics are relatively young branches of science where a lot is happening. It is recommended 
	                             to take notice of these important subjects, and devote time on them according to your taste. Indeed you must know
        	                     that there is feedback from cosmology, astrophysics and astroparticle physics in solving various physics questions. 
	                             But  I can go on this way: what about the physics of other special branches of science: biophysics, geophysics, 
                                     the physics of music, ...	I encourage you to search for other such subjects of interest on the web.

This is a web site (under construction) for young students - and anyone else - who are (like me) thrilled by the challenges posed by real science, 
                     and who are - like me - determined to use their brains to discover new things about the physical world that we are living in. In short, it is for all 
                     those who decided to study theoretical physics, in their own time.It so often happens that I receive mail - well-intended but totally useless - by amateur physicists who believe to have solved the world. They believe this, 
                     only because they understand totally nothing about the real way problems are solved in Modern Physics. If you really want to contribute to our theoretical 
                     understanding of physical laws - and it is an exciting experience if you succeed! - there are many things you need to know. First of all, be serious about 
                     it. All necessary science courses are taught at Universities, so, naturally, the first thing you should do is have yourself admitted at a University and 
                     absorb everything you can. But what if you are still young, at School, and before being admitted at a University, you have to endure the childish anecdotes 
                     that they call science there? What if you are older, and you are not at all looking forward to join those noisy crowds of young students?It should be possible, these days, to collect all knowledge you need from the internet. Problem then is, there is so much junk on the internet. Is it possible 
                    to weed out those very rare pages that may really be of use? I know exactly what should be taught to the beginning student. The names and topics of the absolutely 
                    necessary lecture courses are easy to list, and this is what I have done below. It is my intention to search on the web where the really useful papers and books 
                    are, preferably downloadable as well. This way, the costs of becoming a theoretical physicist should not exceed much the price of a computer with internet connection, 
                    a printer, and lots of paper and pens. Unfortunately, I still have to recommend to buy text books as well, but it is harder to advise you here; perhaps in a future 
                    site. Let’s first limit ourselves to the absolute minimum. The subjects listed below must be studied. Any omission will be punished: failure. Do get me right: you 
                    don’t have to believe anything you read on faith - check it. Try alternative approaches, as many as you can. You will discover, time and again, that really what 
                    those guys did indeed was the smartest thing possible. Amazing. the best of the texts come with exercises. Do them. find out that you can understand everything. 
                    Try to reach the stage that you discover the numerous misprints, tiny mistakes as well as more important errors, and imagine how you would write those texts in a 
                    smarter way.I can tell you of my own experiences. I had the extreme luck of having excellent teachers around me. That helps one from running astray. It helped me all the way 
                   to earn a Nobel Prize. But I didn’t have internet. I am going to try to be your teacher. It is a formidable task. I am asking students, colleagues, teachers to 
                   help me improve this site. It is presently set up only for those who wish to become theoretical physicists, not just ordinary ones, but the very best, those who are 
                   fully determined to earn their own Nobel Prize. If you are more modest than that, well, finish those lousy schools first and follow the regular routes provided by 
                   educators and specialized -gogues who are so damn carefully chewing all those tiny portions before feeding them to you. This is a site for ambitious people. I am 
                   sure that anyone can do this, if one is gifted with a certain amount of intelligence, interest and determination. Now, here begins the serious stuff. Don’t complain that 
                   it looks like being a lot. You won’t get your Nobel Prize for free, and remember, all of this together takes our students at least 5 years of intense study (at least 
                   one reader was surprised at this statement, saying that (s)he would never master this in 5 years; indeed, I am addressing people who plan to spend most of their time 
                   to this study). More than rudimentary intelligence is assumed to be present, because ordinary students can master this material only when assisted by patient teachers. 
                   It is necessary to do exercises. Some of the texts come with exercises. Do them, or better, invent your own exercises. Try to outsmart the authors, but please refrain 
                   from mailing to me your alternative theories until you have studied the entire lot; if you do this well you will discover that many of these authors were not so stupid 
                   after all.Theoretical Physics is like a sky scraper. It has solid foundations in elementary mathematics and notions of classical (pre-20th century) physics. Don’t think that 
                  pre-20th century physics is “irrelevant” since now we have so much more. In those days, the solid foundations were laid of the knowledge that we enjoy now. Don’t 
                  try to construct your sky scraper without first reconstructing these foundations yourself. The first few floors of our skyscraper consist of advanced mathematical 
                  formalisms that turn the Classical Physics theories into beauties of their own. They are needed if you want to go higher than that. So, next come many of the other 
                  subjects listed below. Finally, if you are mad enough that you want to solve those tremendously perplexing problems of reconciling gravitational physics with the 
                  quantum world, you end up studying general relativity, superstring theory, M-theory, Calabi-Yau compactification and so on. That’s presently the top of the sky 
                  scraper. There are other peaks such as Bose-Einstein condensation, fractional Hall effect, and more. Also good for Nobel Prizes, as the past years have shown. A 
                  warning is called for: even if you are extremely smart, you are still likely to get stuck somewhere. Surf the net yourself. Find more. Tell me about what you found. 
                  If this site has been of any help to someone while preparing for a University study, if this has motivated someone, helped someone along the way, and smoothened his 
                  or her path towards science, then I call this site successful. Please let me know. Here is the list.Note that this site NOT meant to be very pedagogical. I avoid texts with lots of colorful but distracting pictures from authors who try hard to be funny. Also, the 
                 subjects included are somewhat focused towards my own interests.LIST OF SUBJECTS, IN LOGICAL ORDER ARE ON THE SIDE.
(Not everything has to be done in this order, but this approximately indicates the logical coherence of the various subjects. Some notes are at a higher level than others).

## Primary Mathematics
Now, first things first. Are you comfortable with numbers, adding, 
                                     subtracting, square roots, etc.?
  - Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, …
  - Integers: …, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …
  - Rational numbers (fractions): $\dfrac{1}{2}$, $\dfrac{1}{4}$, $\dfrac{3}{4}$, $\dfrac{23791}{773}$, $\dots$
  - Real numbers: Sqrt(2) = 1.4142135… ,  π  = 3.14159265… , e = 2.7182818…, …
  - Complex numbers: 2+3i, eia= cos(a) + i sin( a), … they are very important!
  - Set theory: open sets, compact spaces. Topology.You may be surprised to learn that they do play a role indeed in physics!
  - Algebraic equations. Approximation techniques. Series expansions: the Taylor series.
  - Solving equations with complex numbers. Trigonometry: sin(2x)=2sin x cos x, etc.
  - Infinitesimals. Differentiation. Differentiate basic functions (sin, cos, exp).
  - Integration. Integrate basic functions, when possible. Differential equations. Linear equations.
  - The Fourier transformation. The use of complex numbers. Convergence of series.
  - The complex plane. Cauchy theorems and contour integration (now this is fun).
  - The Gamma function (enjoy studying its properties).
  - Gaussian integrals. Probability theory.
  - Partial differential equations. Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.This is for starters. Some of these topics actually come as entire lecture 
                                     courses. Much of those are essential ingredients of theories in Physics. 
                                     You don’t have to finish it all before beginning with what follows next, 
                                     but remember to return to those subjects skipped during the first round.

## Responses & Questions
Please direct any questions, comments or suggestions to Nava Gaddam (gaddam@uu.nl).There already has been some response. I thank: Rob van Linden, Robert Tough, Thuy Nguyen, Tina Witham, 
                                     Jerry Blair, Jonathan Martin, David Cuthbertson, Trent Strong, and many others.Mr. Hisham Kotry came with an important question:"… You sketch the path for potential students through the forest of college level physics… Two years 
                                      ago I decided to self-study theoretical physics by following the syllabus of a renown university and 
                                      the advice from your page and now I’m half-way through the journey but I was wondering about what 
                                      happens next? Quoting you from the former page "In short, it is for all those who decided to study 
                                      theoretical physics, in their own time.", Do you know of anyone who got tenure at a physics department 
                                      or any research institute based on studies he did in his own time without holding a university degree?"This is not so easy to answer, unfortunately. What I can say, is:Eventually, whether you like it or not, you will have to obtain some University degree, if you wish 
                                     a self-supporting career in theoretical Physics. One possibility is to follow aMaster course such as the one offered by our 
                                     University (http://testweb.science.uu.nl/ITF/Teaching.htm). I don’t know about your qualifications, but I suspect that, with enough determination, 
                                     you may be able to comply.This is not a burocratic argument but a very practical one. It is also advisable not to wait until 
                                     you think your self-study is completed. You must allow your abilities to be tested, so that you get 
                                     the recognition that you may well deserve. Also, I frequently meet people who get stuck at some point. 
                                     Only by intense interactions with teachers and peers one can help oneself across such barriers. I have 
                                     not yet met anyone who could do the entire study all by him/herself without any guidance. If you really 
                                     think you have reached a professional level in your studies, you can try to get admitted to schools, 
                                     conferences and workshops in topics of your interest.3/04/06: Message received from John Glasscock, Bloomington, IN:The only one I know of currently is John Moffatt at U Toronto, who was a student of Abdus Salam at 
                                     Imperial College, London. He started life as a painter in Paris, had no undergraduate degree, taught 
                                     himself, corresponded with Einstein, and was admitted, based on his demonstrated original work, at IC.

  - The archimedeans webpage: (http://www.archim.org.uk/notes/)It has a lot of lecture notes in Physics and Mathematics from Part I and II from Cambridge.
  - David Tong’s (DAMTP) lectures in classical mechanics. (http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/dynamics.htm)I found these lectures fascinating.
  - Bo Thide’s (Uppsala) lectures in electromagnetic theory. (http://www.plasma.uu.se/CED/Book/)
  - Angel Uranga’s lectures in String Theory. (http://members.ift.uam-csic.es/auranga/firstpage.html)
  - I found also extremely helpfulMIT’s OpenCourseWare: (http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)Lewin’s lectures in basic Physics are terrific (in video).
  - Michael Fowler’s (Virginia) lectures in Quantum Mechanics. (http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/home.html)(Not checked, G. ‘t H.)Suggestions from Seth Strimas-Mackey:
  - James Binney's (Oxford) (http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/quantum-mechanics)video lectures on Quantum Mechanics.
  - Shankar has two video lecture series that I imagine would be excellent (haven't watched them myself):Series 1 (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE3074A4CB751B2B&feature=plcp)/Series 2 (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD07B2225BB40E582&feature=plcp).  
Both Shankar's and Binney's lectures can be found on iTunes for free.
  - A useful page of lecture notes on several topics in theoretical physics is that ofEric Poisson (U of Guelph) (http://www.physics.uoguelph.ca/poisson/research/notes.html).
  - A page withlecture notes for applied mathematics (http://www.math.umn.edu/~olver/)that is helpful (for example, for learning basic calculus of variations at the level good for physics).
  - For Quantum Field Theory, Mike Luke of U Toronto has an excellent page of references (including his own excellent notes, which are basically an abridged version of the famous Sidney Coleman ones). There are also problem sets on this website which are the best way to learn!Mike Luke (http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~luke/PHY2403_12/References.html)
  - Finally, possibly the most amazing resource of all is the huge collection of lectures on a wide variety of (fairly advanced) topics in theoretical physics from the PSI program at Perimeter Institute:Perimeter Scholars (http://www.perimeterscholars.org/434.html)Suggestion from Daniel MacIsaac:
  - Feynman Lectures
